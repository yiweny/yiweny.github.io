            <p>If there ever exists a piece of simple literature that engraves the true meaning of Zen, then it is this poem:</p>
            <p class="verse">
            <span class="line"> Fundamentally there is no Bodhi-tree，</span><br>
            <span class="line"> Nor stand of a mirror bright，</span><br>
            <span class="line"> Since all is void from the beginning，</span><br>
            <span class="line"> Where can the dust alight？</span><br>

            </p>
            <p>Contrary to the ideology in Buddaism where people are born to suffer. The poem itself captures Zen, which believes that all the pains and sufferings would not exist if our mind is not affected by them. This is surprisingly similar to Adler's statement: "No experience is in itself a cause of our success or failure. We do not suffer from the shock of our experiences--the so-called trauma--but instead we make out of them whatever suits our purpose. We are not determined by our experiences, but the meaning we give them is self-determining."(Page 39, The Courage to Be Disliked).</p>
            <p>Zen believes that if our mind is free from the disturbance of the world, whether good or bad, then we would eventually become a hermit, which by definition is a person who has reached ultimate inner tranquility. On the energy perspective, such tranquility is only reached when a person is able to maintain high or low energy at an extreme level, which the outside happenings cannot affect the inner ecosystem of energy.</p>
            <p>In the mainstream Freudian psycology, we, humans, are just minions or coded bots that build a defensive system against all the traumas we have experienced, especially in early childhood. However, a Zen/Alderian perspective is that we proactively suppress our nature to get wounded and just pretend that the pain/suffering has never happened. It would make sense if we can explain this in terms of energy. When a person has just won a million dollar lottery, then simply getting a 1 gram parking ticket(sounds a bit unrealistic though haha) would not cause him/her too much of a thought. This is because the person has gained enough energy from winning 1m. But if the person has not gained the 1m lottery, then it is for sure that 1 gram parking ticket would not make a lovely day for him/her. </p>
            <p>As I mentioned in my previous post that people turn to drugs when they lack a stable source of energy in life. What Zen and Adlerian psychology is trying to preach to us is that energy can be gained through a healthy way, like studying, sports etc. Proactively earning 1m would bring you enough energy to not care a rediculously high parking ticket. And many people on this planet, unable to understand the so called mental trick, turns to the most convenient solution too quickly, either through doing drugs, or just giving up your goals and accepting failure. As a result, they are stuck at their very limited stages of life.  </p>
