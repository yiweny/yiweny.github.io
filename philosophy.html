                <p>I am not a born philosopher. I just enjoy reading about philosophy, from the works of ancient sages to modern days socialists, or even redditors. My initial enlightenmenet on philosophy comes from reading Chinese analects like Lunyu and Dao De Jing. Later on, a friend of mine introduced me to western philosophy and I read books based on his recommendation, including The Varieties of Religious Experience by Wiiliam James, Not Guilty: A Defense of the Bottom Dog by Robot Blatchford. Eventually, I started to focus on studying life philosophy as a way to deal with the loneliness, stress and sadness in my life. Books like Law of Attraction by William Walker Atkinson have been great inspiration to me. </p>
            <p> The goal of publishing my notes is not to produce great works as incomprehensible to normal individuals as those by David Hume. In fact, I want to provide some hindsight justifications to occurrances in our lives. </p>
