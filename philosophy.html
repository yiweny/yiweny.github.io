                <p>I am not a born philosopher. I just enjoy reading about philosophy, from the works of ancient sages to modern days socialists, or even redditors. My initial enlightenmenet on philosophy came from reading Chinese analects like Lunyu and Dao De Jing, as well as college textbooks on Chinese religions like Zen or Taosim. Later on, a friend of mine introduced me to western philosophy and I read books based on his recommendation, including The Varieties of Religious Experience by Wiiliam James, Not Guilty: A Defense of the Bottom Dog by Robot Blatchford. Eventually, I started to focus on studying life philosophy as a way to deal with the loneliness, stress and sadness in my life. Books like Law of Attraction by William Walker Atkinson have been great inspiration to me. The books on my To-Read list are The Courage to Be Disliked by Ichiro Kishimi.</p>
            <p>I have a very Zen+Taoist view on life. A fun fact is that I believe Zen is the Taoist explanation on Buddism which originates initially in India. On the other hand, I agree to many Darwinistic explanations on human nature. The building stones of my philosophical mind palace, including the idea of energy and value, are inspired by Siqian Gu from Douban.</p>
            <p> The goal of publishing my notes is not to produce great works as incomprehensible to normal individuals as those by David Hume. In fact, I want to provide some hindsight justifications to occurrances in our lives, for example, why do we get heartbroken sometimes, why do people do drugs, etc. Ultimately I want to understand what is the true meaning of living. </p>
