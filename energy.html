            <p>A person's personality is defined by his/her energy levels. People with high energy are the people who are born confident with themselves. They are easy going and generally do not seek for validation from other people. They can generate energy easily and usually are not stingy to spare it among friends. On the other hand, people with low energy are the ones who are on the more sensitive side. They cannot generate energy from within, instead, they look for validation from outside sources, like complishments from others or achievements in work, etc. They are the kind of people who often experience a lot of stress in their lives.  </p>
            <p>People with high energy levels are tend be happier in life while people with low energy levels usually are more "excellent" in social norms. The ideology behind is easy to interpret. People with high energy can be easily satisfied with what they have. Once a person is satisfied in life, there would not be moltivation to work harder. On the other hand, people with low energy are more prone to be affected by the judgement of others. Generally speaking, people who are top in their fields are usually of low energy. </p>
