            <p>A person's personality is defined by his/her energy level. People with high energy are the people who are born confident with themselves. They are easy going and generally do not seek for validation from other people. They can generate energy easily and usually are not stingy to spare it among friends. On the other hand, people with low energy are the ones who are on the more sensitive side. They cannot generate energy from within, instead, they look for validation from outside sources, like complishments from others or achievements in work, etc. They are the kind of people who often experience a lot of stress in their lives.  </p>
            <p>People with high energy levels tend be happier in life while people with low energy levels usually are more "excellent" in social standards. The ideology behind is easy to interpret. People with high energy can be easily satisfied with what they have. Once a person is satisfied in life, there would not be moltivation to work harder. On the other hand, people with low energy are more prone to be affected by the judgement of others. Generally speaking, people who are top in their fields are usually of low energy. </p>
        <p>Love is not a fundamental human need. Obtaining energy from others is. And "love" is just the delusional term we use to describe this action. To love or be loyal to your partner is a moral defined by our social norm and religion. In fact, it's actually just a mental trick. We form a relationship with another person, either a romantic relationship or just a normal friendship, because the person that we'd like to bond to has something of value to us. We want to connect with the person so as to gain energy, whether through getting care or attention from that person or through the connection itself. Think about the easy example. Even in the early stages of our lives, like in primary or middle school, kids like to be friends with attractive peers. Why so? There could be many reasons, but obviously being close to someone cool gives you a lot of validation from your sourroundings. </p>
        <p>When we start a relationship, our initiative is to gain energy from the person we value. And similarly a relationship ends when at least one party has soaked up enough energy from the other, at least for that moment. The reason why a relationship can start is because both people value each other and they are on approximately the same energy level. </p>
        <p>And now it comes to the ultimate question--Why am I getting dumped?--a question troubling billions of lonely souls on our planet. Despite many love experts having different opinions on this matter, the anwer is simple and one and only. This is because you have much lower value placed on yourself than whoever dumps you. You put the person at a much more important position than your inner self in your mind. </p>
        <p>How is your self-validation related to your energy? You can either generate energy from within(yep you are one of the few high energy people on earth), or you can generate energy from self-achievement(you prolly won't be so sad for getting dumped if next day in the morning you earned 1m in stock market or received Nobel prize). But for a lot of people who are feeling sad for getting mistreated by their partners, their primary source of energy generation is from other person. And it's a pretty sad fact that we are all taught to work hard to earn the life we want but we are seldom taught to not rely on one specific person for energy and validation. We are taught to "create energy", through either caring or giving, to other people, especially our families, friends and romantic partners. But the truth is that the more you invest on the person, the more you expect them to be a source of energy generation. We would be sad if our parents and closest friends cannot understand our anxiety but we wouldn't do so if a stranger doesn't care about our mental health. </p>
        <p>This leads to the most important conclusion to this blog. Value is the reason that a relationship can start and your control of energy is the factor that determines whether a relationship can last. As a good piece advice for people suffering pain from relationships, stop looking for energy from "the person" or simply go find someone else that can spare you energy. Usually the first one is way hard to achieve and for normal people the second one is a way better choice. </p>
