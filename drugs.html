        <p>As mentioned earlier, people have different energy levels. A Darwinistic perspective on the specific energy level of a person is that it is dependent on our nature and our environment. The nature, is by definition, our genes. Males and females are born with different with hormone levels. By observation, women are more prone to experiencing stress and loneliness than men. And by personal experience, women are more easily triggered when they are on period. The environment is more often related to our upbreeding in early childhood. A tiger mom's kids are usually of lower engery level than thoses brought up by more easy going parents. The energy level of a person, however, is not the deciding factor of a person's behaviors. It is in fact a person's inner self-validation that tells if a person would engage in activities like doing drugs, smoking weed or being abnormally horny.</p>
        <p>Life isn't easy. In Buddhism's perspective, people are more to suffer. Our mind is born with a self-protection mechanism and it's our human instinct to look for solutions to pain. As babies, we cry out loud when we are not feeling well. But when we grow up, almost everyone knows that crying is no longer an option. Instead, we turn to other ways. </p>
        <p>One way is to work hard and achieve self validation through your progress. As each of us is born with a self-protection mechanism, we are also born with a lazy string. Working hard is not an easy solution and more often than not it takes long to be in effect. In this case, options like doing drugs, drinking alcohol or having sex pops up. They are faster in effect. We can forget about our pains and anxiety easily. </p>
        <p>How does this relate to energy? People with absolutely high level of energy often times do not do drugs because they can seldom feel pain in their lives. They are just too happy. </p>
